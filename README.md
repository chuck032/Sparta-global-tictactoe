## JQuery Selectors and Events - TicTacToe

For this project I was required to build the game TicTacToe in the browser using JQuery. I was provided with the html layout for the game. I needed to use what I had learnt so far with selecting things with JQuery and creating event listeners with JQuery to create this game.

Requirements:

* The game should display the correct 'X' or 'O' for each button pressed in the browser
* Once a tile has been clicked it should not be able to be clicked again
* The reset button should clear the board
* When a winning condition is present you should display and winner, wither X or O
* The program should use functions, JQuery selectors and JQuery events
